### Project Description
Simple shell is an ALX SE project aimed to build a simple UNIX command line interpreter.
It is designed to mimic sh and can handle basic commands, manage errors, and support some common shell functionalities. It is written in C, and reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets, and executes them.

##  Requirements
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
*   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   You are not allowed to use global variables.
*   No more than 5 functions per file.
*   All your header files should be include guarded.
*   You should have an `AUTHORS` file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. Format, see [Docker](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/AUTHORS).

##  Authorized functions and system calls
*   `access` (man 2 access)
*   `chdir` (man 2 chdir)
*   `close` (man 2 close)
*   `closedir` (man 3 closedir)
*   `execve` (man 2 execve)
*   `exit` (man 3 exit)
*   `_exit` (man 2 _exit)
*   `fflush` (man 3 fflush)
*   `fork` (man 2 fork)
*   `free` (man 3 free)
*   `getcwd` (man 3 getcwd)
*   `getline` (man 3 getline)
*   `getpid` (man 2 getpid)
*   `isatty` (man 3 isatty)
*   `kill` (man 2 kill)
*   `malloc` (man 3 malloc)
*   `open` (man 2 open)
*   `opendir` (man 3 opendir)
*   `perror` (man 3 perror)
*   `read` (man 2 read)
*   `readdir` (man 3 readdir)
*   `signal` (man 2 signal)
*   `stat` (__xstat) (man 2 stat)
*   `lstat` (__lxstat) (man 2 lstat)
*   `fstat` (__fxstat) (man 2 fstat)
*   `strtok` (man 3 strtok)
*   `wait` (man 2 wait)
*   `waitpid` (man 2 waitpid)
*   `wait3` (man 2 wait3)
*   `wait4` (man 2 wait4)
*   `write` (man 2 write)

### Compilation

Your code will be compiled this way:

```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

```

# Tasks

**0. Betty would be proud**
---

Write a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks.

- - -

**1. Simple shell 0.1**
---
Write a UNIX command line interpreter.

*   Usage: `simple_shell`

Your Shell should:
*   Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
*   The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
*   The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
*   The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
*   If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
*   Handle errors.
*   You have to handle the “end of file” condition (`Ctrl+D`)

You don’t have to:
*   Use the `PATH`.
*   Implement built-ins.
*   Handle special characters : ", ', `, \\, *, &, #.
*   Be able to move the cursor
*   Handle commands with arguments


**2. Simple shell 0.2**
---
Simple shell 0.1 +
*   Handle command lines with arguments.
- - -


**3. Simple shell 0.3**
---
Simple shell 0.2 +
*   Handle the `PATH`.
*   `fork` must not be called if the command doesn’t exist.


**4. Simple shell 0.4**
---
Simple shell 0.3 +
*   Implement the `exit` built-in, that exits the shell.
*   Usage: `exit`.
*   You don’t have to handle any argument to the built-in `exit`.
- - -


**5. Simple shell 1.0**
---
Simple shell 0.4 +
*   Implement the `env` **built-in**, that prints the current environment.
---


**6. Simple shell 0.1.1**
---
Simple shell 0.1 +
*   Write your own `getline` function.
*   Use a buffer to read many chars at once and call the least possible the `read` system call.
*   You will need to use `static` variables.
*   You are not allowed to use `getline`.
You don’t have to:
*   Be able to move the cursor.
---


**7. Simple shell 0.2.1**
---
Simple shell 0.2 +
*   You are not allowed to use `strtok`.
---


**8. Simple shell 0.4.1**
---
Simple shell 0.4 +
*   handle arguments for the built-in `exit`.
*   Usage: `exit status`, where `status` is an integer used to exit the shell.
---


**9. setenv, unsetenv**
---
Simple shell 1.0 +

Implement the `setenv` and `unsetenv` builtin commands:
*   `setenv`
    *   Initialize a new environment variable, or modify an existing one.
    *   Command syntax: `setenv VARIABLE VALUE`.
    *   Should print something on stderr on failure.
*   `unsetenv`
    *   Remove an environment variable.
    *   Command syntax: `unsetenv VARIABLE`.
    *   Should print something on stderr on failure.
- - -


**10. cd**
---
Simple shell 1.0 +

Implement the builtin command `cd`:
*   Changes the current directory of the process.
*   Command syntax: `cd [DIRECTORY]`.
*   If no argument is given to `cd` the command must be interpreted like `cd $HOME`.
*   You have to handle the command `cd -`.
*   You have to update the environment variable `PWD` when you change directory.
`man chdir`, `man getcwd`
- - -


**11. ;**
---
Simple shell 1.0 +
*   Handle the commands separator `;`.
- - -


**12. && and ||**
---
Simple shell 1.0 +
*   Handle the `&&` and `||` shell logical operators.
- - -


**13. alias**
---
Simple shell 1.0 +
*   Implement the `alias` builtin command.
*   Usage: `alias [name[='value'] ...]`:
    *   `alias`: Prints a list of all aliases, one per line, in the form    *  `name='value'`.
    *   `alias name [name2 ...]`: Prints the aliases `name`, `name2`, etc 1 per line, in the form `name='value'`.
    *   `alias name='value' [...]`: Defines an alias for each `name` whose `value` is given. If `name` is already an alias, replaces its value with `value`.
- - -


**14. Variables**
---
Simple shell 1.0 +
*   Handle variables replacement.
*   Handle the `$?` variable.
*   Handle the `$$` variable.
- - -


**15. Comments**
---
Simple shell 1.0 +
*   Handle comments (`#`)
- - -


**16. File as input**
---
Simple shell 1.0 +
*   Usage: `simple_shell [filename]`.
*   Your shell can take a file as a command line argument.
*   The file contains all the commands that your shell should run before exiting.
*   The file should contain one command per line.
*   In this mode, the shell should not print a prompt and should not read from `stdin`.
